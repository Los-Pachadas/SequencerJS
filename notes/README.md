## Running a Local Server

Usually to get your HTML pages to appear on the browser you need to at least run a local server. Unless it is 100% HTML.
Python has the ability to quickly create a local server on any directory. So, to run a local server:

1) Make sure you are in the directory with your HTML pages  
2) Run the command
	``` python3 -m http.server {port number| ex. 8000} ```  
3) To see the page you need to go to any browser and go to you localhost and into the port you
	selected. For example, in Google Chrome you can go to localhost:8000 or if you want to use the
	ip address instead, you can go to 127.0.0.1:8000.
